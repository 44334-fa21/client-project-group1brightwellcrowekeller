  <img src="Images/Susan.jpg" alt="SusanEcker">
<p>Susan has been providing counseling support to
  children, adolescents, adults, and families in southwest
  Iowa since 2003.  She earned her Master of Social Work
  degree from University of Missouri in 2002.  Susan has
  a passion for working with adults that are experiencing
  some form of loss or life transition to include divorce,
   chronic illness, conflictual relationships, and grief
    associated with death and dying. For most of her practice,
  she has treated a full range of symptoms with cognitive-based
   approaches to include the practice of mindfulness.  In 2019,
     Susan became a EMDR trained therapist. She is amazed, after
    all her years of practice as a therapist, in how utilization
    of the EMDR protocol rapidly produces reduction of symptoms and
    restoration of balance. Susan was born and raised in northwest Missouri.
    She and her husband live on a farm in Missouri.  Susan spends most of her
  time away from work outdoors and has a deep love of nature.
  She enjoys spending time with friends and family, hiking, golfing,
  gardening, and watercolor painting.  Susan holds a strong belief in
  mind body connection and practices yoga and meditation.

              <h4>Caroline Obermiller, TLMHC</h4>
              <img src="Images/Caroline Obermiller.jpg" alt="CarolineOdermiller">
              <p>Caroline grew up in West Wales and moved to US after marrying her husband. One of the first
               things people often comment on is her accent. Caroline attended Missouri Baptist University in
             St Louis for both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees. As a Registered Play Therapist, Caroline
              believes strongly in the power of play and the healing properties it offers. Play is the language
             of childhood and through play we support growth, strength, and individuality throughout all phases
             of our life. Utilizing play therapy with EMDR allows for a unique opportunity for therapy to be tailored
             to meet the needs of each client she meets. Caroline approaches therapy with humor, positivity, and a belief
             that each of us has unlimited potential. One of her favorite phrases is “there are no wrong answers in here.”
              Caroline will walk alongside each client and meet them wherever they are at in their journey. In her spare time,
              Caroline loves to travel, read, take trainings, and spend time on her front porch. She currently has two cats, one
              dog, three children and a husband who often shakes his head in wonder at her ideas. Time with family and friends is
               always a priority to her.
