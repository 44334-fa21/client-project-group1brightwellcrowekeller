Denise D. Crosson, Ph.D. has been a nurse for thirty-eight
 years, a nurse practitioner for twenty one years, and a nurse
  researcher for sixteen years. Her first job working with
  children was in high school as a lifeguard and swim instructor

   children and their families in hospital, home, hospice, and
  community-based settings. She earned a masters and doctoral degree from
 Virginia Commonwealth University where she was a fellow in the
VA-LEND neurodevelopmental disabilities training program, which focused on
 children and families. Her dissertation research focused on short- and

  <h4>Stephanie Gray, ARNP</h4>

  <p>
    I earned a bachelor’s degree in Nursing from Nebraska Methodist
    College in 1996. I then earned a master’s degree in the Family
   Practice Nurse Practitioner program from Creighton University in 2004.
 I went on from there to earn a post-master’s certificate in Psychiatry from
 Creighton University in 2006. I have extensive experience in the Emergency
 Department delivering medical care as well as Psychiatric care. I have
  practiced in close to every level of psychiatric care available which
  brings a seasoned and well-rounded view into my practice abilities. I have
  a very special interest in Individuals with intellectual disabilities and
   co-morbid psychiatric illnesses. I enjoy the autonomy that my dual licensures
    provide for me. However, I am also a collaborator with many other disciplines,
     as they say, “it takes a village”. Although, I have carried these advanced
     degrees for an extended period of time, I am a nurse and love to teach students
     at all levels…. Empower those that are our future!
