    <h2> About Us </h2>
    
    <p> Waubonsie Mental Health Center  strives to empower people to achieve their hopes, dreams, and quality of life goals by delivering quality, integrated, trauma-informed behavioral health care.  Waubonsie Mental Health Center opened in 1981, and became an accredited Community Mental Health Center in 1984.  Since that time, we have seen incredible growth within our organization - as well as in the people we serve!  WMHC offers a comprehensive set of services, ranging from outpatient therapy to drop-in peer support services.  We currently have offices in Clarinda, Red Oak, and Shenandoah, Iowa.  The Cetner does not discriminate in regard to race, color, creed, national origin, sex, religion, age, sexual orientation, physical disability, or mental disability in providing services in any of our programs.</p>

    <h2> FAQ's </h2>
        
    <h4> How have you adjusted your services to adapt to the COVID-19 Pandemic?</h4>
        
    <p> At Waubonsie, the safety of our clients and staff is our highest priority.  To mitigate the risk of a Covid infection occurring at one of our sites, we've implemented increased cleaning/hygiene measures throughout our facilities and have vastly expanded our telehealth offerings to offer services to clients from the comfort and safety of their own homes.  Additionally, all staff, clients, and others entering one of our facilities may choose to wear a mask if that is their preference.  Individuals exhibiting signs of illness at the time of their appointment will be provided with the option to receive services via telehealth from their homes.</p>

    <h4> Some of the things I need to talk about are very personal - Will discussions with my provider remain private and confidential?</h4>
        
    <p> As an accredited Community Mental Health Center, we are legally and ethically required by HIPAA to protect your healthcare information.  We will not release ant information about your care - or even confirm your status as a patient - to an outside entity without your written permission.  The one exception to this rule is in the event that we believe that there is a serious risk to your safety or someone else's.  In such a situation, we would only provide pertinent information to the appropriate authorities required to ensure yours and others safety.</p>
